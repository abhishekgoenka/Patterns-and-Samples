## Synopsis
The project is a simple one-page HTML website. However, by setting this code up together, it helps to demonstrate various gulp tasks. The project is developed in open source text editor - [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

You are more than welcome to add in any additional code that you would like, but for the sake of simplicity and clarity, the code examples in this project designed specifically to demonstrate the work this tasks will do to our code.

## Downloading and installing node.js
As you know node.js and npm are the engines that work behind the scenes that allow us to operate gulp and keep track of any plugins we decide to use. For Mac and Windows, the installation is quite simple. All you need to do is navigate over to [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and click on the big green INSTALL button. Once the installer has finished downloading, run the application and it will install both node.js and npm.
